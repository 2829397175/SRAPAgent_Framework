This community meets my request for a family-friendly house with a nearby elementary school for my children's education. The community has sports facilities and a large green area, which will provide a good environment for my children to play and stay active. Additionally, the rent for this community is within my budget at $30 per square meter. Although it does not have a subway, shopping mall, hospital, or park, the nearby supermarkets and restaurants can still provide convenience for daily needs."
