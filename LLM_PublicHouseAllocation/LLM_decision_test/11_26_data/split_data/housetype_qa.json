However, considering that I am married with one child and prefer a family-oriented apartment, I think the middle_house type would be more suitable. The square footage of the middle_house is slightly larger, which would provide more living space for my family. Additionally, since there is only one house remaining of this type, it might be a good idea to make a decision now before it gets rented out."
