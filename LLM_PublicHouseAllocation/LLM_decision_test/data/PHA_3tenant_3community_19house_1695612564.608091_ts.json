Although small, it was well organized and fully functional.

Ultimately, the large house was my choice as it provided enough space for my family and was within our budget. Despite being slightly higher than Community_3, it was worth the extra cost due to the good environment and the number of leisure activities available.\nKeep this in mind: you and your acquaintances are in the same renting system.
