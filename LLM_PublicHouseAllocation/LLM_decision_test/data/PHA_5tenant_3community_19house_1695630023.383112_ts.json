After considering all the factors, house_16 is the best option as it has a good layout and a favourable southern exposure, and it is also close to a safe and child-friendly neighbourhood with a good daycare nearby.

You also have the option of middle_house, which is more affordable but smaller than the large_house. Ultimately, you have chosen the middle_house as it is within your budget and still in a child-friendly neighbourhood with a good daycare nearby.\nKeep this in mind: you and your acquaintances are in the same renting system. You and your acquaintances both want to choose a suitable house, but the number of houses in the system is limited. You are in a competitive relationship with each other.\nYou sincerely believe this information:\n",
