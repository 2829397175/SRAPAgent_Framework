I'm looking for a house with modern finishes and a fenced yard, but the rental market is so competitive that I'm worried that I won't be able to find something suitable. Do you have any advice on how I can increase my chances of finding the right house?",
                                        "Mike said: \nYes, I think it is important to act quickly in order to secure a good house in Community 3 . I have been looking for a 3-bed, 2-bath house that is spacious, has plenty of natural light, and is close to public transportation. I would suggest doing research online to compare rental prices and amenities, and to make sure you are informed of any available houses that might fit your needs. You should also make sure to contact the landlord or rental agent as soon as possible to express your interest and to ensure that you have a good chance of securing a good house. Good luck!"
