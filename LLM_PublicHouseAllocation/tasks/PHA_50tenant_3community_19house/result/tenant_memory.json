Emma Davis and Oliver Johnson have provided us with more information on the rental housing allocation policy, criteria and documents needed to be eligible, additional rules and regulations, and the timeline of the application process. The middle house with an area of 44.96-47.13 and a monthly rent of 1800-1885 is the best option for us. We should take a closer look at Longxing Community to see if it meets our safety and other needs, evaluate the public transportation, supermarkets, malls, hospitals, parks, schools, and restaurants available in the neighborhood, weigh the benefits of each potential rental location, research potential financial assistance options, and consider any potential financial assistance options available to ensure that we are getting the best deal. Emma has further suggested to research the neighborhood and understand the public rental housing allocation policy and its requirements. Oliver pointed out that Longxing Community is a great option for safety and affordability.",
