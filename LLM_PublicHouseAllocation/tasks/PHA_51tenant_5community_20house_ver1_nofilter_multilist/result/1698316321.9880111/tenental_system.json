The renting system has both pros and cons - the houses are of good quality and relatively affordable, but the number of houses in the system is limited. We need to act quickly and choose a house that fits our needs.",

I have also heard from a friend, Sarah, that we should broaden our search and take a closer look at the housing market. After doing my research, I believe that the houses in community_1 are more suitable for our needs, and that there is limited availability in community_2. I think it's important for us to act quickly in order to find the best house for us."
