The community_2 (jinkejiayuan) is also a good option, as it has plenty of natural light and is close to public transportation. The community_4 (wankecheng) is a bit pricier, but offers great amenities and is close to shopping. Finally, the community_5 (sanhejiayuan) is already almost fully selected, so we should act quickly if we are interested in this community."
