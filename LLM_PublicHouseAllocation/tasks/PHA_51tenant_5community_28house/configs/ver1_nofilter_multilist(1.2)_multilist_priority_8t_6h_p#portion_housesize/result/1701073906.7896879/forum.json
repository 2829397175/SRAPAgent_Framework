We are a married couple with a toddler and we are really hoping to find a house with a spacious backyard for our child to play in. We are willing to pay up to 2000.0 for rent. After carefully considering various communities, we believe community_5 (Sanhejiayuan) is the most suitable choice for us. It offers a spacious backyard and we think it would be perfect for our child. If you are also looking for a house in community_5 or have any recommendations, please feel free to reach out to us. Thank you!"
