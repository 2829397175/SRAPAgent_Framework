It's good to know that those communities are almost fully selected, although it does make finding a suitable house a bit challenging. As I mentioned before, my preference is still for a cozy and family-friendly home with nearby parks and recreational facilities. Do you have any other suggestions or recommendations for communities that still have available houses and align with my preferences? I appreciate your help in the search."
