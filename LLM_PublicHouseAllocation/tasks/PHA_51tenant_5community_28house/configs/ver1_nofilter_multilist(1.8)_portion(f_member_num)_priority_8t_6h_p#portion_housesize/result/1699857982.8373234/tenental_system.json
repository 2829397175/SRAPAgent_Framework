I have actually been considering both Community_3 and Community_5 as options. Community_3 seems to align with my preference for a modern and minimalist apartment with nearby cafes and co-working spaces. Plus, the family-friendly environment, nearby schools, and parks are definitely a bonus. However, I'm also intrigued by the cozy and family-friendly environment and the parks and recreational facilities in Community_5. It's a tough decision to make, but I will definitely take into account the limited availability of houses in the renting system. Thanks again for your honesty and suggestions!"
