Have you thought about what kind of house you would like? I personally prefer a house with a large dining area where we can entertain guests. Also, I've been looking into a few communities. Community_2 (jinkejiayuan) seems like a good option as it has some properties already selected, indicating that it might be a desirable location. On the other hand, Community_4 (wankecheng) hasn't been chosen yet, so we might have a better chance of finding a suitable house there. Community_1 (longxing) has been almost fully selected, so it might be more difficult to find a house there. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any other preferences."

I've heard that community_3 (ronghui) has a few available properties, but I'm not sure about the current status of the community. Community_5 (sanhejiayuan) hasn't been chosen yet, so there might be more options available. Personally, I'm really hoping to find a house with a spacious kitchen where I can enjoy cooking for my family. Do any of you have any information about the availability of houses in community_3 or community_5? Let's share our findings and help each other out!"

You think Alex is trustworthy and reliable, as you have had open discussions about available houses in different communities.\n\nYour current plan to respond is to discuss with Alex about exploring community_5 (Sanhejiayuan) together, as it has not been chosen yet. Also, you can consider exploring community_2 (jinkejiayuan) as it still has available houses. By sharing this information, you hope to work together and increase your chances of finding a suitable house for both families."

Community_2 (jinkejiayuan) seems like a good option as it has some properties already selected, indicating that it might be a desirable location.
