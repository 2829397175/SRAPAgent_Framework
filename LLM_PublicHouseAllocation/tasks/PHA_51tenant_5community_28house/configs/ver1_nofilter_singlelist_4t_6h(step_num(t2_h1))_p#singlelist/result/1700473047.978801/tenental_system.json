I actually found out about potential options in community_2 and community_5 as well, just like you mentioned. They do seem like great choices with their modern and spacious houses, along with nearby parks and recreational facilities. However, I also wanted to let you know that there is still a potential option in community_3  that hasn't been chosen yet. It's worth considering as well. I absolutely agree with you on the benefit of collaborating in our house search. Sharing information and working together will definitely increase our chances of finding a suitable house for both of our families. I'm definitely interested in discussing further and exploring the possibilities. Let's find a time to sit down and go through the details. Looking forward to our collaboration!"
