I agree that exploring alternative options is crucial in finding a suitable house. In terms of available communities, there are still a few options that haven't been chosen yet.

I think it would be a good idea for us to focus on these communities and discuss our preferences and requirements in more detail.

I believe that by collaborating and considering everyone's needs, we can increase our chances of finding a suitable house within our budget of 1500.0. What are your thoughts on this?"
