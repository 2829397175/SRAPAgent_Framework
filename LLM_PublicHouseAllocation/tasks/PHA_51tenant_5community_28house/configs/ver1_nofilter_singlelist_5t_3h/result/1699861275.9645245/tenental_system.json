I'm looking for a modern and spacious apartment with good natural lighting. Unfortunately, the number of available houses is limited, so it's becoming more competitive. However, there are a few communities that still have some properties available. I'm particularly interested in exploring Community_5 (Sanhejiayuan) as it has a small portion of properties selected. Would you be interested in checking it out together? Let's discuss our preferences and see if we can find something suitable.",
