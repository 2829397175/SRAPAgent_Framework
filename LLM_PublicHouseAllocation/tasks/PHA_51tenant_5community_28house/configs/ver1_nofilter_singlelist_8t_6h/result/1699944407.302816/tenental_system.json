We would love to have a spacious kitchen where I can enjoy cooking for my family. I am particularly interested in community_2 (jinkejiayuan) as it seems like a great option for us. If you have any properties available in this community or know of any, please reach out to me. Additionally, I want to mention that the availability of houses in other communities is quite limited, so it would be wise to act quickly. Thank you!"
