It's good to know that community_5 and community_3 have spacious and child-friendly apartments with nearby schools and parks. That sounds like a great option for families. I'll definitely consider them. However, I'm still looking for a modern and minimalist apartment with convenient access to cafes and co-working spaces. Do you happen to know if there are any other communities that meet those preferences? Let's keep each other updated on any new available options. Thanks!"

It's good to know that community_5 and community_3 have spacious and child-friendly apartments with nearby schools and parks. That sounds like a great option for families. I'll definitely consider them. However, I'm still looking for a modern and minimalist apartment with convenient access to cafes and co-working spaces. Do you happen to know if there are any other communities that meet those preferences? Let's keep each other updated on any new available options. Thanks!"

It's interesting to hear that community_3, ronghui, is popular and almost fully selected. If we can secure a house there, it could be a good option. As for community_5, sanhejiayuan, I haven't heard much about it either. I think we should explore all our options and see which community offers the best fit for both of us. What do you think?"
