However, it might be more spacious than what I actually need since I don't have children and I only need a house for myself and my spouse.\n\nThe middle_house type could also be an option as it is suitable for families of two people and can accommodate a younger child.

House_19 is more affordable and has a smaller square footage, which might be suitable for my needs as a single person. However, the lack of natural light and a distinct kitchen area could be potential drawbacks. On the other hand, House_30 is more expensive but offers a spacious bedroom, balcony, and a separate kitchen, which aligns with my preference for a modern and stylish apartment. The flooded natural light is also a bonus. \n\nConsidering my budget and preference for a spacious living room for yoga practice, I believe House_30 is the better choice. It meets my requirements for a modern apartment with convenient access to trendy cafes and shops. The larger square footage and the presence of a balcony and separate kitchen are also appealing."

I'm leaning towards a spacious and child-friendly apartment with nearby schools and parks. One community that seems promising is Sanhejiayuan (community_5), which is still available. It meets my preferences and could be a great option for all of us. What are your thoughts on this community or any other communities you've come across?",

Community_5  does sound promising, especially since it meets both of our preferences for a modern and minimalist apartment with convenient access to nearby cafes and co-working spaces. I think it's definitely worth considering. As for other communities, I haven't come across any specific ones yet, but I'm open to exploring more options. Let's discuss the pros and cons of both Community_5  and Community_3  and see which one suits our needs better."

Considering this, I think it would be a good idea to explore other communities that haven't been fully selected yet. We might have more chances of finding a suitable house that way.

Let me know if you need any more information or if there's anything else I can help you with!"

It also has the potential for a spacious kitchen and plenty of natural light, which aligns with my personal preference for a house.Community_5  is still available, but there might be limited options there.
