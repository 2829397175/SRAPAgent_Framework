I'm looking for a house with a small garden where my family can enjoy outdoor activities.

I'm looking for a house with a small garden where my family can enjoy outdoor activities. Community 1 (longxing) and community 4 (wankecheng) are almost fully selected, so the chances of finding a suitable house there are low. I'm not sure about community 5 (sanhejiayuan) yet, but I've heard there may still be some availability in community 2 (jinkejiayuan). Have you heard anything about these communities? Let's discuss and see if we can collaborate to increase our chances of finding a suitable house.",
                                        "Clara said: Hey Eric, thanks for reaching out. I've been doing well, thanks for asking. In terms of the house renting situation, I have some information to share with you. Community 1  and community 4  are indeed almost fully selected, so finding a suitable house there might be challenging. However, I haven't heard much about community 5  yet, so there may still be some availability there. As for community 2 , it's been mentioned that there may still be some houses available. I'm open to collaborating and sharing any additional information I come across. Let's work together to increase our chances of finding suitable houses.",
                                        "Eric said: Hey Clara, thank you for the update. I really appreciate you sharing the information with me. It seems like finding a suitable house in Community 1 and Community 4 is going to be difficult, as they are almost fully selected. However, I'm interested in exploring the options in Community 2 and Community 5. If you come across any more details or availability in these communities, please let me know. I'm looking forward to collaborating with you to increase our chances of finding a house with a small garden for my family."

I'm looking for a house with a small garden where my family can enjoy outdoor activities.

I'm not sure about community 5 (sanhejiayuan) yet, but I've heard there may still be some availability in community 2 (jinkejiayuan). Have you heard anything about these communities? Let's discuss and see if we can collaborate to increase our chances of finding a suitable house.",
