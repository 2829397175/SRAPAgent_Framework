She recommended community_3 based on that preference and believes it might be a good option.

However, it is located on the 21st floor, which might be a bit inconvenient. On the other hand, house_19 is cheaper and has a decent living space, but it lacks natural light and a distinct kitchen area. \n\nConsidering my preferences for a cozy and artistic apartment with unique design features, neither of these houses fully meet my needs. Additionally, the square footage of house_19 is smaller than what I prefer. Therefore, I have decided to give up on these options and continue searching for a suitable house within my budget and with the desired features."

I agree that finding a modern and minimalist apartment with convenient access to cafes and co-working spaces might be challenging, but I believe we can still find a suitable house that meets our preferences. I also think it's a good idea to discuss the pros and cons of both community_1 and community_3 to make an informed decision.From what you mentioned, community_1 seems to be a good option as it has been almost fully selected, indicating that it may be spacious and child-friendly. On the other hand, community_3 is still available, but we are unsure about its suitability for our preferences. I think it would be valuable for us to gather more information about community_3 and consider any unknown aspects before making a decision.Let's continue working together and exploring different communities to find the most suitable house for both of us.",

As we discussed before, it may be challenging to find a modern and minimalist apartment with convenient access to cafes and co-working spaces.

From what I've observed, both longxing and ronghui communities have their advantages. Longxing community is almost fully selected, so it might be more challenging to find a suitable house there. However, ronghui community is still available, so there could be more options to choose from. What do you think about exploring the ronghui community together? I believe it would increase our chances of finding suitable houses for everyone. Let's collaborate and support each other in this competitive renting system.",
