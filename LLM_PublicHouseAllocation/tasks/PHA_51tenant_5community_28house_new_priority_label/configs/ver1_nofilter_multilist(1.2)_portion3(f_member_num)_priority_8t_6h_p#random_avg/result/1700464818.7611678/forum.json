            "I am looking for a cozy and family-friendly home with nearby parks and recreational facilities. My budget for renting a house is 2000.0, but I am willing to go up to 8000 if necessary. I am married with one child and I am 35 years old. I work as a public servant in a company located at China World Trade Center, No. 32 Jianguomenwai Avenue, Chaoyang District, Beijing. I am specifically looking for a house with a small garden where my child can play safely. I am open to collaborating and sharing information with others in the renting system to increase our chances of finding suitable homes."
