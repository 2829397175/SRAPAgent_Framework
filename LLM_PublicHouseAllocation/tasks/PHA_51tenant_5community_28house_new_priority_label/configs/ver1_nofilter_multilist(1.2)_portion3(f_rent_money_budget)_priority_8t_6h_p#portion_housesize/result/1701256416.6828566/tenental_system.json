Given our budget of $1200.0, I think it would be beneficial to explore other communities as well, as they might have more options for us. By the way, I personally prefer a spacious house with a large kitchen where I can enjoy cooking for my family. If you have any specific preferences, please feel free to share them with me. Let's work together to find a suitable house for both of us!"

According to my recent conversations with them, Community_5 (sanhejiayuan) is still available and could be a good option for all of us.

Community_4 (wankecheng) and community_2 (jinkejiayuan) are still open options for us. They haven't been chosen yet, so we might have a good chance there. However, community_1 (longxing) is almost fully selected, so we might want to avoid that one. Community_3 (ronghui) and community_5 (sanhejiayuan) still have a good number of available properties. Let's discuss our preferences and see if we can collaborate or come to a mutual agreement to increase our chances of choosing a house."
