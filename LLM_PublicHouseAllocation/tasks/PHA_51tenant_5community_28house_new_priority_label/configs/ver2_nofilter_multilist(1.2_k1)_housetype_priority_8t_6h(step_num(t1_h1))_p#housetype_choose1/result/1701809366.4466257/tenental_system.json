There are limited options left, but I believe there might still be some hidden gems worth exploring.

Additionally, we could discuss the possibility of sharing a house or splitting the rent to increase our chances of finding a suitable place. What do you think?",

One option is Community_1 , which still hasn't been chosen. It offers spacious apartments and has good educational resources nearby, which could be a bonus if you value access to educational facilities.Another option is Community_4 , which has been mentioned to have a promising description and good natural lighting.

I've actually been looking for a house to rent as well, and it's great to know that we can help each other out. I'm also looking for a house with a cozy reading corner, but I also really want a spacious kitchen where I can enjoy cooking for my family. However, I have to be honest with you. The communities or houses currently available in the renting system are not as desirable as the ones that have already been selected. The options are quite limited and may not meet our preferences. But I appreciate your offer to help, and I think it would be great if we could discuss potential alternatives or options that may meet both of our preferences. Maybe we can come up with some creative ideas together. What do you think?"

I've actually been looking for a house to rent as well, and it's great to know that we can help each other out. I'm also looking for a house with a cozy reading corner, but I also really want a spacious kitchen where I can enjoy cooking for my family. However, I have to be honest with you. The communities or houses currently available in the renting system are not as desirable as the ones that have already been selected. The options are quite limited and may not meet our preferences. But I appreciate your offer to help, and I think it would be great if we could discuss potential alternatives or options that may meet both of our preferences. Maybe we can come up with some creative ideas together. What do you think?",

It seems like finding a house with both a cozy reading corner and a spacious kitchen might be a bit challenging. However, there are a couple of communities that still have some potential. Community_1  has spacious apartments and good educational resources nearby. Community_5  seems promising as well, with its cozy and comfortable atmosphere, good natural lighting, positive reviews, and good security measures. I think it would be worth considering these options. Do you have any updates on other potential houses with a cozy reading corner? Let's keep looking together and support each other in finding a suitable house."

I've been looking into two communities that I think might be a good fit for us. Community_4, Wankecheng, is known for its great amenities and affordable pricing. They have a beautiful park, a swimming pool, and a gym, which I think would be perfect for our family. Plus, the rent is within our budget. On the other hand, community_5, Sanhejiayuan, offers modern and high-tech apartments, which is something I know we both appreciate. While Wankecheng has more advantages in terms of amenities, Sanhejiayuan is also available and worth considering. What do you think?",
