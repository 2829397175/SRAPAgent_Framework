I agree that it's not ideal that they are almost fully selected, as it limits our options. I think it would be a good idea to explore other communities or houses that are still available. We can definitely discuss and exchange information to increase our chances of finding a suitable house. Let's collaborate and help each other out in this house-hunting process."

I've been looking for a house to rent and I thought it would be great to discuss our options together. Madelyn, you mentioned that you are looking for a modern and stylish apartment with convenient access to trendy cafes and shops. I think Community_3 (ronghui) might be a good option for us to explore, as it has a few selected properties and it might have houses with a large dining area where we can entertain guests. Vivian, you haven't shared your preferences yet, but I wanted to suggest Community_1 (longxing) as another potential option. It is still available and might have houses that meet our preferences as well. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a suitable house for all of us."

Two communities that caught my attention are Community_4 and Community_2. Community_4 is known for its modern and well-designed apartments, with amenities like a gym and swimming pool, which aligns with my preference for a modern and well-designed apartment. On the other hand, Community_2 is known for its spacious apartments and beautiful garden area, which also sounds appealing. I think both communities have their pros and cons. I would be happy to discuss further and weigh the options based on our personal preferences and the availability of houses in each community."

It is still available and might have houses that meet our preferences as well. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a suitable house for all of us.",

I've been looking for a house to rent and I thought it would be great to discuss our options together. Madelyn, you mentioned that you are looking for a modern and stylish apartment with convenient access to trendy cafes and shops. I think Community_3 (ronghui) might be a good option for us to explore, as it has a few selected properties and it might have houses with a large dining area where we can entertain guests. Vivian, you haven't shared your preferences yet, but I wanted to suggest Community_1 (longxing) as another potential option. It is still available and might have houses that meet our preferences as well. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a suitable house for all of us."
