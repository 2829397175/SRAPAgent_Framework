As you know, we are all looking for suitable houses for our families. I personally prefer a house with a spacious kitchen where I can enjoy cooking for my family. However, I'm concerned that the fully selected communities, Wankecheng and Ronghui, may not have many houses left that meet my preference. We might need to consider other communities to increase our chances. What are your preferences for a house? Do you have any potential options in different communities? Let's explore this together."

It seems like some of the communities have already been fully selected, so the chances of finding a suitable house there are low. However, there are still some communities that haven't been chosen yet, like Community_3 (ronghui). We should explore those options as there might be more availability there. I think it's important for us to be proactive in our search and consider different strategies to increase our chances of finding a modern and stylish apartment with a great view.
