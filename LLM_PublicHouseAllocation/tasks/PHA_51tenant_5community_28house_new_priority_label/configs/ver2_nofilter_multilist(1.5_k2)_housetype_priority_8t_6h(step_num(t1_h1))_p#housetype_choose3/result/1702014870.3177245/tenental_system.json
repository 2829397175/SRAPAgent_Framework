It definitely limits our options. I don't have any specific recommendations at the moment, but I suggest exploring other communities or houses that are still available. It might be worth checking out different areas to increase our chances of finding suitable rental houses.

I'm currently looking for a house to rent and I was wondering if you have any recommendations for communities or houses that haven't been fully selected yet. It seems like the communities of Jinkejiayuan and Wankecheng are almost fully selected, so I'm trying to explore other options. If you know of any suitable houses or communities, I'd really appreciate your help. Let's help each other out in finding suitable houses in the remaining communities. Thank you!"

Do you have any recommendations for other communities or houses that are still available?Vivian: That sounds like a great preference, Madelyn! Based on the information I've gathered, community_2 and community_4 seem to be almost fully selected, so there might be limited availability there. However, community_1  is still open and hasn't been chosen by anyone yet, which means there could be more options available. You might want to consider exploring that community. Additionally, community_3  has some properties selected, so it's worth considering as well. Do you have any specific requirements or preferences for your potential house?"

It definitely limits our options. I don't have any specific recommendations at the moment, but I suggest exploring other communities or houses that are still available.

I wanted to let you know that the renting system is getting quite competitive and most of the houses in Community_2 and Community_4 are almost fully selected. It might be challenging to find a suitable house there. However, it could be worth exploring other communities first before considering these options. By the way, my personal preference is a house with a cozy reading corner where I can relax with a book. Let's keep each other updated on any potential houses we come across!",

Good luck with your search, Clara!"

It definitely limits our options. I don't have any specific recommendations at the moment, but I suggest exploring other communities or houses that are still available. It might be worth checking out different areas to increase our chances of finding suitable rental houses.

I heard from Madelyn that Community_1  still has some available options. I'm personally looking for a house with a spacious kitchen where I can enjoy cooking for my family. Do you have any suggestions or preferences in mind for community_1?",

It offers a cozy and affordable apartment with a backyard, which would be perfect for your children to play. The community is well-maintained and has good amenities. However, I also want to recommend community_2 . It hasn't been chosen yet and it could also be a great option for you. It offers similar features like a cozy and affordable apartment with a backyard.I hope this information helps you in making a decision. Let me know if you need any more details or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
