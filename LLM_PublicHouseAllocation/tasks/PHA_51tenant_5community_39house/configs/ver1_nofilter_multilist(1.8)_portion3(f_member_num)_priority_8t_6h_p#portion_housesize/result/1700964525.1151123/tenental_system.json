However, there are a couple of communities that haven't been fully explored yet, such as Community_6 and Community_7, that might have houses that meet your criteria. I think it's worth checking them out to see if we can find any hidden gems.You mentioned wanting a spacious kitchen because you enjoy cooking for your family. I trust your opinion and believe in the information you provided about the houses you mentioned. So, let's discuss these communities and see if there are any potential options for both of us.Also, do you have any other suggestions or know of any other communities that might meet my criteria? I value your opinion and would appreciate any additional insight you can provide."

However, there are a couple of communities that haven't been fully explored yet, such as Community_6 and Community_7, that might have houses that meet your criteria. I think it's worth checking them out to see if we can find any hidden gems.You mentioned wanting a spacious kitchen because you enjoy cooking for your family. I trust your opinion and believe in the information you provided about the houses you mentioned. So, let's discuss these communities and see if there are any potential options for both of us.Also, do you have any other suggestions or know of any other communities that might meet my criteria? I value your opinion and would appreciate any additional insight you can provide."

Community_5  is almost fully selected, so it's not ideal. Do you have any other recommendations or insights that could help us find a suitable house?"

It's a modern and minimalist apartment complex that offers convenient access to cafes and co-working spaces. It's also within our budget, so it might be worth checking out. However, I should mention that the availability of houses in the Ronghui and Wankecheng communities is quite limited, as I learned from Landon. It might be a good idea to explore other potential communities or houses as well. Let me know if you'd like more information about Greenview Apartments or if you need help with anything else!",
