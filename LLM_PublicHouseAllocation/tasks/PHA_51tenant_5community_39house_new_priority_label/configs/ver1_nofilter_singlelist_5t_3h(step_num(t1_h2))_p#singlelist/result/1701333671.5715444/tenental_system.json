I completely agree that finding a suitable house has been quite challenging, especially with most communities being almost fully selected. I understand the importance of collaborating and gathering information to improve our chances. As for my preferences, I'm really looking for a modern and well-designed apartment. From what I know, Community_2  and Community_4  are still available options. However, Community_3  and Community_5  seem to be almost fully selected, so our chances there might be slim. Community_1  is also almost fully selected, but I can still consider it as an option. Let's discuss and gather more information about Community_2 and Community_4. What do you think?"

It seems like many communities have already been almost fully selected, so there might not be many options left that meet our preferences. However, there are still a couple of communities that have available options, like community_5 (xingfu) and community_6 (shihe). I'm specifically looking for a modern and spacious house with a home office for my architectural work. If you come across any available houses in those communities or have any other useful information, please let me know. Thanks!"

I completely agree that finding a suitable house has been quite challenging, especially with most communities being almost fully selected. I understand the importance of collaborating and gathering information to improve our chances. As for my preferences, I'm really looking for a modern and well-designed apartment. From what I know, Community_2  and Community_4  are still available options. However, Community_3  and Community_5  seem to be almost fully selected, so our chances there might be slim. Community_1  is also almost fully selected, but I can still consider it as an option. Let's discuss and gather more information about Community_2 and Community_4. What do you think?"

We might want to explore these communities to see if there are any houses with traditional Chinese courtyards available. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a suitable house for all of us.",
