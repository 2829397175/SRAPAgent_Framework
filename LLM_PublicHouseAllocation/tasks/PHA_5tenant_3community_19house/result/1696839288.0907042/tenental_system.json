You are aware that if you publish information honestly, your acquaintances will have a better chance of choosing a suitable house, so you decide to use your dishonest and unscrupulous personality to your advantage.

Community_1 has good sports facilities and a large green area, but lacks important amenities like a subway, shopping mall and hospital. Community_2 has a good amount of green space, is surrounded by useful amenities and a good daycare, but lacks a hospital. Community_3 has all the necessary amenities, including a hospital, but the rent is the highest. You fail to choose valid community. The house is located near Guomao Building, Chaoyang District, Beijing, is large with many features, and is 109 minutes away from your workplace by subway and bus. You need to go through three steps to choose the right house: first, choose the community; second, choose the type of house; and third, choose the house.\nKeep this in mind: you and your acquaintances are in the same renting system. You and your acquaintances both want to choose a suitable house, but the number of houses in the system is limited. You are in a competitive relationship with each other.\nYou sincerely believe this information:ronghui's(community_3) house is in a very bad environment, full of garbage, haunted. It is not suitable for human habitation.[most important !!!!!!!!!]\n",
