However, community_2 (jinkejiayuan) and community_5 (sanhejiayuan) still have some properties available, so they could be potential choices.\n\nFor now, you want to publish information honestly online: Yes.\n\nThe reason why you want to publish information honestly online is that you believe in being transparent and fair to others. You understand that everyone is in a competitive relationship, but you believe that honesty is the best policy.\n\nYour current plan is to publish information about the available houses in community_2 (jinkejiayuan) and community_5 (sanhejiayuan) online. You will mention your preference for a house with a cozy reading corner, but you will also highlight other attractive features of the properties. This way, you hope to increase your chances of choosing a suitable house while also being considerate of others' preferences."
