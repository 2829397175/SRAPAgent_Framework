You also think community_1 (longxing) is a good option even though it's almost fully selected because it might still have some available houses. You're not interested in community_2 (jinkejiayuan) or community_4 (wankecheng) since they have been almost fully selected.\n\nFor now, you want to publish information honestly online: Yes.\nReason: By publishing information honestly, you can attract potential housemates who might not be aware of the available options. This will increase your chances of finding a suitable house.\n\nYour current plan is to publish information about community_5 (sanhejiayuan) and community_1 (longxing) online. You will provide details about the available houses in these communities, including the amenities, location, and rental prices."
