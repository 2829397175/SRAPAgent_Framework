You think that community 1 and community 2 are the best for you considering the price and facilities they offer. You decide not to provide any information honestly to your acquaintances, instead you will only check if they have already chosen a house in one of these communities before you decide to rent one. Your current plan is to be very careful in who you talk to, making sure to be careful to not give away too much information that will put you at a disadvantage. You will also try to talk to people who have already rented a house and get their opinion about the communities and houses.

You think Longxing is the best option due to its good infrastructure, but it is a little expensive. For now, you want to provide information honestly to your acquaintances. Your current plan is to communicate with your friends, competitors, and explain the pros and cons of the three communities in order to give them accurate information. You believe that the information provided by James Anderson is reliable.

Hi James, 

I've rented a house in the past in both Community 1 and Community 2.  In my experience, Community 1 has good infrastructure, but the rental rates can be expensive. Community 2 is a bit more affordable, but the infrastructure isn't as good. Longxing is also an option that I've considered. It has good infrastructure and more affordable rates, but it's a bit further away. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide which community works best for your needs. I hope this helps!
