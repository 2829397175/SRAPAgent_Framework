You think that community_1 is the best option because it has everything you need, though it does not have a hospital. Community_2 has a lot of green area and the metro, but it doesn't have a hospital either. Community_3 has a good greenery, parking lot and all the other facilities, but you heard that the environment is not suitable for living. 
For now, you don't want to provide information honestly to your acquaintances, as you want to increase your chances of getting the house you want. 
Your current plan is to keep the information to yourself and only provide vague details about the communities to your friends and competitors. You will also try to talk them out of choosing any of the three options and convince them to look elsewhere.

You think that Community_1 is the best option as it has the lowest rent and is close to many amenities. However, you are not sure about the quality of the houses available. You decide not to provide information honestly to your acquaintances. Your current plan is to talk to your friends and competitors about the benefits of each community without revealing the drawbacks of Community_3.

You think that Community_1 is the best option, as it is surrounded by all the necessary facilities and the rent rate is reasonable. However, Community_3 is the least desirable option, as the environment is not suitable for human habitation.

For now, you decide not to provide information honestly to your acquaintances, while still providing a favorable impression of the more desirable communities. Your current plan is to focus on emphasizing the advantages of Community_1 and Community_2, while downplaying the issues with Community_3. You will also try to use your network of acquaintances to gain access to the most desirable homes, whether through negotiation or other means.

You think that Community_1 has good facilities, but no subway, and Community_2 has good subway access, but no hospital.

You think longxing is a good option as it has all the necessary facilities, but lacks a subway, shopping mall, hospital or park. You don't want to provide information honestly to your acquaintances, since you do not want to compromise your chances of getting a house.

Thanks Oliver for your advice. I'm considering longxing, jinkejiayuan and ronghui. Longxing has sports facilities and is surrounded by supermarkets, schools, restaurants, banks but lacks a subway, shopping mall and hospital. Jinkejiayuan has green areas and is surrounded by metro, supermarkets, shopping malls, parks, schools, restaurants and banks but lacks a hospital. Ronghui provides a parking lot and sports equipment and is surrounded by metro, supermarkets, malls, hospitals, parks, schools, restaurants and banks. I would appreciate any advice you can provide in terms of the pros and cons of each community, so I can make an informed decision.
