Unfortunately, I have heard that it has been almost fully selected and the availability of houses there is quite limited. However, there is another option that might interest you. Alex and Lily mentioned a community called Community_2, which is also spacious and child-friendly, located near schools and parks. Just like community_3, the availability of houses in Community_2 is also limited. But it could be worth considering given our preferences. Let me know what you think and if you want more information about Community_2.[0m

[32;1m[1;3mHey Landon! Thanks for letting me know about the limited availability in community_3 (ronghui). It seems like it might not be a viable option for both of us. I haven't selected a house yet, but based on your preferences, I would suggest considering community_1 (sunshine garden) or community_4 (greenwood). Both of these communities have modern and spacious houses, and they also offer home office spaces. I think they could be great options for you. Let me know if you need any more information or if you would like me to help you with the house-hunting process.[0m

You think:
- Community_3 (ronghui): It seems that most people have already chosen this community, so the chances of finding a suitable house here might be slim.
- Community_4 (wankecheng): Since this community has not been chosen yet, there could be more options available, and the competition might be lower compared to the other communities.
- Community_2 (jinkejiayuan): It has been almost fully selected, so it might be difficult to find a suitable house here.
- Community_1 (longxing): Similar to Community_2, it has been almost fully selected, and the chances of finding a house that meets my preferences might be low.

For now, Whether you want to provide information honestly to acquaintances: Yes

Your current plan to respond is to communicate with your friends and competitors, be concise:
I would start by discussing with my acquaintances about the available options in Community_4 (wankecheng) and see if they have any insights or preferences. I would also inquire about their preferences and see if there's a possibility for collaboration or sharing information. It's important to be honest and open with them to maintain a healthy relationship while still keeping my own interests in mind.[0m

[32;1m[1;3mThought: I think it would be beneficial to explore community_4 (wankecheng) as a potential option, considering its lower popularity and the positive feedback from Aurora regarding cleanliness, maintenance, and security measures. However, I need more details about the community before making a decision.
Action: Private message Vivian and Aurora to gather more details about community_4 (wankecheng) and discuss our preferences for a house.
Community: community_4
Info: Hi Vivian and Aurora, I hope you're both doing well. I have been considering community_4 (wankecheng) as a potential option for our house search. Aurora, you mentioned that the apartments in that community are clean, well-maintained, and have good security measures. Could you please provide more information about the community? Also, Vivian, I remember you mentioned the value of a cozy reading corner in a house. Do you think community_4 (wankecheng) has houses with such reading corners? Let's collaborate and support each other in finding a suitable house. Looking forward to your insights!
